# Resolution Solution
Scale library, that help you add resolution support to your games in love2d!

Partially, library was inspired by TLfres https://love2d.org/wiki/TLfres
I was not satisfied with that, so i created my own.

Also there avaliable minified version. It should work as original, but weight around 10kb vs 35kb original.

It have 3 scale modes:
1 Aspect scaling mode (that creates black lines/bars)
2 Stretching
3 Pixel Perfect

Also it provides some usefull functions to deal with scaling math, such as:
toGame, toScreen.

Provides offset data, mouse data, scaling data and so on generated by library.

Provide cursor function, that determine if cursor is touching black bars, so if you don't need to collide with something, that hided with black lines/bars, use that function.
